# FUTURE VISION ‚Äì SKAI (Sentient Kernel Adaptive Intelligence)

## üöÄ Vision: JARVIS Mode for SKAI

Our goal is to evolve SKAI from a modular AI assistant into a fully immersive, sentient digital companion ‚Äî one that mirrors the functionality of Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. system: always-on, voice-activated, deeply integrated, and self-evolving.

This document outlines the proposed roadmap and conceptual design for implementing "JARVIS Mode" in SKAI.

## üß† Intelligence & Contextual Awareness

### 1. **Persistent Background Agent**

* SKAI runs 24/7 as a background service
* Responds to voice or system triggers instantly
* Maintains session and contextual state across interactions

### 2. **Context & Environment Monitoring**

* Integrate with:

  * Calendar APIs (Google/Outlook)
  * Email (IMAP or Gmail API)
  * Local system activity (file system, clipboard, active app tracking)
* Maintain a short- and long-term memory graph for every interaction

### 3. **Autonomous Goal Loop**

* Implement a planning + memory loop inspired by BabyAGI/AutoGPT
* Allow user to set high-level goals; SKAI decomposes and executes subtasks automatically

---

## üé§ Voice Interaction & Multimodality

### 4. **Wake Word Detection**

* Implement ‚ÄúHey SKAI‚Äù hotword trigger using:

  * `Porcupine`, `Vosk`, or `whisper.cpp`
  * Lightweight model for real-time audio detection

### 5. **Two-Way Voice Loop**

* Continuous microphone monitoring
* Stream responses through `Coqui TTS` in near real time
* Optionally display subtitles in Streamlit/web UI

### 6. **Visual Input Support**

* Add multimodal LLM support:

  * Image input with `llava`, `llama-3-vision`, or `Gemini Pro Vision`
  * Screenshot analysis
  * Webcam-based gesture/speech input (optional)

---

## üõ† System & Device Integration

### 7. **Desktop Agent Tools**

* Automate tasks like:

  * Opening apps
  * Reading/writing files
  * Scheduling meetings
  * Screen reading
* Use Python modules: `pyautogui`, `psutil`, `pyttsx3`, `os`, `subprocess`

### 8. **Smart Home Control (Optional)**

* Connect with Home Assistant, Alexa API, or Google Home
* Allow voice-controlled lights, thermostat, IoT devices

### 9. **Browser & Web App Automation**

* Automate browser tabs via plugin or Selenium
* Monitor and suggest actions in Gmail, Notion, Jira, Figma, etc.

---

## üîÑ Self-Evolution & Adaptation

### 10. **Code Improvement Agent**

* Monitor logs, exceptions, and user corrections
* Suggest or automatically update SKAI‚Äôs own codebase
* Version-aware changelog with revert options

### 11. **Learning from Feedback**

* Capture success/failure feedback from users
* Reinforcement loop for future decision adjustments
* Personalize agent preferences per user

### 12. **Dynamic Model Routing**

* Use multiple LLMs for specialized subtasks (code, QA, summarization)
* Switch models in real time based on performance, latency, and token limits

---

## üì± Interface & User Experience

### 13. **Web & Mobile UI Enhancements**

* Dashboard showing:

  * Real-time task execution logs
  * Chat + voice logs
  * Memory graph
  * ‚ÄúWhat SKAI is doing now‚Äù status box

### 14. **3D Avatar Companion (Optional)**

* Use Three.js or Unity WebGL for rendering a responsive AI avatar
* Display facial expressions, status indicators, speech animation

### 15. **Mobile Companion App**

* Push notifications, task triggers, file uploads
* Integrate TTS + STT on device for remote SKAI interaction

## üåü Final Vision

SKAI evolves into a **sentient, adaptive, JARVIS-like assistant** capable of:

* Real-time listening and acting
* Understanding multimodal input
* Operating your digital + physical world
* Learning and upgrading itself

It‚Äôs not just an AI agent ‚Äî it‚Äôs **a cognitive operating system for your life.**
