# FUTURE VISION ‚Äì SKAI (Sentient Kernel Adaptive Intelligence)

## üöÄ Vision: JARVIS Mode for SKAI

Our goal is to evolve SKAI from a modular AI assistant into a fully immersive, sentient digital companion ‚Äî one that mirrors the functionality of Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. system: always-on, voice-activated, deeply integrated, and self-evolving.

This document outlines the proposed roadmap and conceptual design for implementing "JARVIS Mode" in SKAI.

## üß† Intelligence & Contextual Awareness

### 1. **Persistent Background Agent**

* SKAI runs 24/7 as a background service
* Responds to voice or system triggers instantly
* Maintains session and contextual state across interactions

### 2. **Context & Environment Monitoring**

* Integrate with:

  * Calendar APIs (Google/Outlook)
  * Email (IMAP or Gmail API)
  * Local system activity (file system, clipboard, active app tracking)
* Maintain a short- and long-term memory graph for every interaction

### 3. **Autonomous Goal Loop**

* Implement a planning + memory loop inspired by BabyAGI/AutoGPT
* Allow user to set high-level goals; SKAI decomposes and executes subtasks automatically

---

## üé§ Voice Interaction & Multimodality

### 4. **ChatGPT-Like Voice Conversations**

* Implement natural, flowing voice interactions similar to ChatGPT
* Enable multi-turn conversations with context preservation
* Support voice interruptions and real-time responses
* Add voice activity detection for natural turn-taking
* Implement voice tone and sentiment analysis
* Create voice-specific response formats (more conversational)

### 5. **Wake Word Detection**

* Implement "Hey SKAI" hotword trigger using:

  * `Vosk` (offline, grammar-based)
  * `Porcupine` (lightweight keyword spotting)
* Ensure low false positive/negative rates
* Add visual confirmation when wake word is detected
* Support personalized wake words

### 6. **Advanced Speech Processing**

* STT with `Whisper` (base/small model)
* TTS using **open-source options**:

  * `Coqui TTS` (natural and customizable)
  * `Piper` (lightweight, offline, fast)
* Stream responses using `pydub` or `sounddevice`
* Implement adaptive noise cancellation
* Support multiple voice styles and personalities
* Add support for multiple languages

### 7. **Visual Input Support**

* Add multimodal LLM support:

  * Image input with `llava`, `llama-3-vision`, or `Gemini Pro Vision`
  * Screenshot analysis
  * Webcam-based gesture/speech input (optional)

## üõ† System & Device Integration

### 8. **Desktop Agent Tools**

* Automate tasks like:

  * Opening apps
  * Reading/writing files
  * Scheduling meetings
  * Screen reading
* Use Python modules: `pyautogui`, `psutil`, `pyttsx3`, `os`, `subprocess`

### 9. **Smart Home Control (Optional)**

* Connect with Home Assistant, Alexa API, or Google Home
* Allow voice-controlled lights, thermostat, IoT devices

### 10. **Browser & Web App Automation**

* Automate browser tabs via plugin or Selenium
* Monitor and suggest actions in Gmail, Notion, Jira, Figma, etc.

---

## üîÑ Self-Evolution & Adaptation

### 11. **Code Improvement Agent**

* Monitor logs, exceptions, and user corrections
* Suggest or automatically update SKAI's own codebase
* Version-aware changelog with revert options

### 12. **Learning from Feedback**

* Capture success/failure feedback from users
* Reinforcement loop for future decision adjustments
* Personalize agent preferences per user

### 13. **Dynamic Model Routing**

* Use multiple LLMs for specialized subtasks (code, QA, summarization)
* Switch models in real time based on performance, latency, and token limits

---

## üì± Interface & User Experience

### 14. **Web & Mobile UI Enhancements**

* Dashboard showing:

  * Real-time task execution logs
  * Chat + voice logs
  * Memory graph
  * "What SKAI is doing now" status box
* Voice recognition status indicator
* Waveform visualization for voice input/output

### 15. **3D Avatar Companion (Optional)**

* Use Three.js or Unity WebGL for rendering a responsive AI avatar
* Display facial expressions, status indicators, speech animation
* Lip-sync with speech output

### 16. **Mobile Companion App**

* Push notifications, task triggers, file uploads
* Integrate TTS + STT on device for remote SKAI interaction
* Background wake word detection
